<jeffgruber>OH man, now we finally got rid of all those stupid fluffy animals!
<benjaminbutton>I don't raelly feel good about it. What did they ever do?
<jeffgruber>Just exist honestly. Every time I look at them I just want to punch their cuddly faces
<jeffgruber>I can't focus on all my evil duties it distracts me so much
<benjaminbutton>But did you have to carpet bomb them with oil?
<jeffgruber>You tell meeeeee a better way to make them less fluffy and I'll give you a raise
<benjaminbutton> Just gonna go out on a limb here, but I think you might be your latent flufosexuality coming out
<jeffgruber>WTF DID YOU JUST SAY?
<benjaminbutton>I was just saying...
<jeffgruber>HOW DARE YOU?!?!? I WOULD NEVER?!?!? Just because I was found in a stuffed toy factory as a child, that doesn't mean I like them!
<jeffgruber>And just because I have 30 warrants for assaulting furries at clubs, that don't mean nothing!
<jeffgruber>PS your're fired and your family is all dead
